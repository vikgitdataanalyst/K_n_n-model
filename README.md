The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model is implemented using the Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset from Kaggle. 

The workflow consists of the following steps:

Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to extract relevant features and labels.
Splitting the Data: The data is divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to evaluate model performance.
Standardization: Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to normalize the data and improve KNN's performance.
Training the KNN Model: The KNN algorithm is trained with different values of K (number of neighbors).
Evaluating Accuracy: The model's accuracy is computed for each K using accuracy_score.
Plotting K vs. Accuracy: A graph is plotted to visualize the impact of different K values on model accuracy, helping to determine the optimal K.

This process helps in understanding how K affects model performance and choosing the best parameter for the KNN classifier.
